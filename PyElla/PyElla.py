"""
A set of classes to help separate Spanish names into each of their parts. The
ParseNamesCSV class implements the reading of a CSV file, replacement of the
column containing the full name with three columns for each component and writing
to a new file.

Limitations are:
 - Not all compound given names are accounted for.
 - Some compound given names can actually be a first surname, e.g RamÃ³n can be
   either a compound given name or a first surname.

The first limitation can be alleviated by adding missing compound given
names to config/compound_tokens_givenname.txt

The second limitation currently has no workaround. Plans are to incorporate a
"problematic" flag to compound given names. When a problematic compound given
name is found it will be stored in a list with its details for review by a
human.
